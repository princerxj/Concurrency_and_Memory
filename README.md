# Concurrency and Memory Management

This repository is part of my learning journey in Data Science, focusing on Python concurrency and memory management concepts.

## Topics Covered

- **Multithreading**: Understanding thread-based parallelism in Python
- **Multiprocessing**: Exploring process-based parallelism for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Memory Management**: Learning efficient memory handling techniques

## Files

- `multi_threading.py` - Basic multithreading concepts
- `advance_multi_threading.py` - Advanced multithreading patterns
- `usecase_multi_threading.py` - Practical multithreading use cases
- `multi_processing.py` - Basic multiprocessing concepts
- `advance_multi_processing.py` - Advanced multiprocessing patterns
- `factorial_multiprocessing.py` - Factorial calculation using multiprocessing
- `memory_manage.ipynb` - Memory management techniques and demonstrations

## Purpose

This repository contains hands-on examples and experiments to understand concurrency patterns and memory optimization in Python, essential skills for data science and high-performance computing.
